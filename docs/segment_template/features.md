# Features

Overview:
The SQL Segment Scheduler feature in our system allows users to specify scheduling logic based on intervals. This documentation outlines the functionality and usage of this feature.

1. Scheduling Logic - Interval:
Users can define scheduling logic based on intervals. This allows them to set specific time frames for executing SQL segments.

2. SQL Segment Creation and Assignment:
Users have the ability to create SQL segments and assign them to specific targets within the system. This enables the segmentation of data based on custom SQL queries.

3. Creation and Reuse of SQL Templates:
The system supports the creation and reuse of SQL templates, serving as building blocks for segment creation. For instance, users can define templates such as "All customers that visited page {x} within {y} period." These templates can be used to create default and custom recipes, which users can reuse across various segments.

Higher Order Segment Customization:
This feature allows users to customize segments without the need to directly edit SQL code. By leveraging predefined SQL templates and logical intervals, users can create and manage segments efficiently.

Conclusion:
The SQL Segment Scheduler feature offers users the flexibility to define scheduling logic, create and assign SQL segments, and reuse templates for segment customization. By simplifying the process of segment creation and customization, users can efficiently manage their data segmentation tasks within the system.
