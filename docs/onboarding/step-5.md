# Step 5 - Import your orders from the eCommerce platform 

Once you're connected to your eCommerce you can start importing orders. Press the "Go to page" button below, find your connected platform, check if it's connected and press Import. For the first try, we recommend choosing data for 5-7 days, later you can import all-time orders if needed.

**If you signed-up with a Done-For-You setup service, you can skip this step. Our service team will import it for you.** 

1. Press "Import"
2. Choose day count you want to import

*Note: Import can take 10 min or so depending on data size imported.
**Note: If you have a lot of reviews this process might take an hour or more.

Once it's imported you will be able to:

* Send review invitations to customers
* Create customer segments from your orders data
