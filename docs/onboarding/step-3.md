# Step 3 - Import your reviews from the Source 

Once you're connected to your source(s) it's time to import reviews from them. Press the "Go to page" button below, find your source, check if it's connected and press Import. For the first try, we recommend choosing data for 5-7 days, later you can import all-time reviews if needed.

**If you signed-up with a Done-For-You setup service, you can skip this step. Our service team will import it for you.** 

1. Press "Import"
2. Choose day count you want to import

*Note: Import can take 5 min or so depending on data size imported.
**Note: If you have a lot of reviews this process might take an hour or more.

You will be able to combine different reviews from each of your source(s). Press the "Go to page" button below, find the source you want to use. You will need then to fill in the required credentials for a successfull connection.

Note: You can connect only 1 account per source.
