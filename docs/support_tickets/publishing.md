* Event Collection: All events already published for the given timestamp period (in days) are collected.
* Duplicate Filtering: Reviews already published are filtered out to avoid duplication caused by updates to the same review.
* Ticket Generation: Tickets are generated by applying templates to each review.
* Ticket Posting: Reviews are posted as tickets to the Customer Support API.
